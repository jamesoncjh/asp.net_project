# Scenario

You work as a software developer for the fictitious ThreeAmigos Corp. The company wishes to overtake its rival ManshaCo by expanding into the event management market.
You have been given the responsibility for constructing a new intranet-based system to help deliver this service.

A data model and system architecture has been agreed by all stakeholders. It has been decided that an existing web service will be used for reserving event venues. 
It has also been decided that catering will be created as an independent web service because of the potential for selling on as a thirdparty service to other companies.
